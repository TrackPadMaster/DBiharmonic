So the new version of this code is very slightly different

You'll notice that there are now three different scripts, and with new names

You'll also have multiple "input" files, but you only need to look at one

InputStart is the main input file that you should make any changes to
The only change you'll need to make though is altering the force value F0 or atom number.

BiharmShell.sh is the main overarching code
Inside of that code is a list of the gamma values that you're going to use
All you need to do is separate the values by a space

FortranRunner.sh is a new version of myscript.sh
It contains all of the phi values inside of it

DataCollect.sh is the new get_v_phi

InputStart is the file that BiharmShell pulls from

Input0 is a file generated by BiharmShell.sh, and you won't ever need to make changes to it

Inside the foldrs, Input.dat is generated from the Input0 file


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

Open up InputStart
Make any changes you want to the F0 or atom number values
Save the file

Open up BiharmShell.sh
Make any changes you want to the list of gamma values to be used
Save the file

Run ./BiharmShell.sh

The terminal should pop up with messages like "Now running gamma = 2.0"
This new code will run through each gamma in the list without any intervention
At the end, you'll have a bunch of "**Gam.dat" files in your folder

Make a new folder called ***Force_200Potential, where *** is what you used for F0 (e.g. 80, 100, 150)
Move all of the "**Gam.dat" files into that folder

Repeat for as many different forces you want to run.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For DBiPlot3.py:
Click run, select the folder with the data folders from the box that pops up
It should automatically plot all of the values
This time, it's properly sorted
